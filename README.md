# IPL-Score-Predictor-using-Machine-Learning
I have developed a Machine Learning-based IPL Score Predictor that forecasts the final score of a team during an ongoing match using real-time input parameters. The project utilizes historical IPL data and regression techniques to build a predictive model that can assist in sports analytics and match strategy.
